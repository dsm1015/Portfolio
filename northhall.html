            <p>
                I lived in North Hall my sophomore year at SRU, and I've always admired its beautiful
                architecture.
                Upon wanting to learn Blender, I decided to model the building.
                I took several pictures of the building and used them as references to hopefully capture as much
                detail as possible.
                The whole process took about 6 months of on-and-off work, but I certainly learned a lot about 3D
                modeling, texturing, and rendering.
                Don't ask me how many vertexes this model has (It's way too many).
