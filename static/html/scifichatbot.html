            This project is a fairly simple LLM chat wrapper that uses OpenAI to "talk" to 
            science fiction characters. Since I'm not a fan of writing papers, I asked my 
            English profressor if this would be an acceptable substitute. It turned out to
            be pretty cool, and made for a unique way to interact with the different characters that we read about.

            The app itself stores some basic information about the characters,
            and sends it off alongside the prompt that the user enters. Of course, it's
            not very resistent to "jail-breaking" out of the context that I intended,
            but it worked well enough to impress my professor.
