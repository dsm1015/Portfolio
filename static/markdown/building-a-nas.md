# Building a NAS

This is my experience building a NAS/home server.

## Hardware

First, I needed a computer. My goal was to spend as little money as possible, while still building something worthwhile. I found this FaceBook Marketplace listing for a Dell Precision T3600 for **$150**.

*insert FB image here*

The listing also included a monitor, keyboard, and mouse. I didn't need any of those, so I ended up talking the seller down to **$115**. Not too bad for a 4 core processer rated at 3.60Ghz, as well 16Gb memory.

Unfortunately, the existing storage situation was a little lacking. It only came with a 250gb HDD. So I did some more online shopping to for some NAS hard drives. I wanted to the *majority* of my media on this NAS, but I also didn't want to break the bank (which I discovered it pretty easy to do when it comes to buying hard drives).

I opted for two recertified Seagate IronWolf Pro HDDs with 4TB of storage. I ended up snagging two at a pretty decent price. Having two HDDs was also nice, because that meant I could at least do a RAID 1 configuration.

## Software

I decided that I would use TrueNas for this setup.
