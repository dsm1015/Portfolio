            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>
                I created this simulator for a computer science AI class, with the goal of simulating traffic
                based on zones (residential, commercial, and offices). Another goal of mine was to mimic popular
                game engines
                and integrate best OOP practices.
                The app includes a UI
                and an editor for creating zones, as well several different options for configuring the
                simulation.
                It was inspired by the popular Steam game <a
                    href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/cities-skylines/about" target="_blank"
                    class="link">Cities Skylines</a>.
                This project was created using Java with Swing graphics.
            </p>
            <h2>Logic</h2>
            <p>
                Much of the logic is handled at the agent level. Each agent has a set of rules that determine
                where they will travel. For instance, when an agent is spawned in a residential zone, that zone
                is declared as its home. The agent will then select an office to work in, and based on
                attraction rates, they will visit a nearby commercial zone.
            </p>
            <p>
                Of course, there are many other factors that go into the agent's decision making
                that are not included in this simulation. For instance, agents do not have a concept of time,
                so there is no rush hour or time when the agent is "sleeping". Traffic is generated by citizens
                going to work, going home,
                and visiting nearby shops over and over and over.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can also select which search algorithm you would like the agents to use.
                These include A Star, Breadth First, and Depth First searches. The algorithms
                will travel along a node and edge data structure that I designed and implemented
                within the road cells.

            <h2>Overlays</h2>
            <p>
                The main appeal of this project is the ability to create zones and watch the traffic flow
                through
                overlays. You can toggle the overlays to see the traffic density and attraction of different
                zones.

            <h2>Engine</h2>
            <p>
                I created my own engine for this project, which is responsible for updating the agents and
                rendering
                the graphics. The engine itself is fairly simple. It uses a timer to update the agents'
                decisions
                and repaint the grid accordingly.
